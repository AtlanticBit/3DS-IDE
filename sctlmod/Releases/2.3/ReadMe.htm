    <h2>Introduction<a name="Introduction"></a></h2>
    <p>
        ScintillaNET is a powerful text editing control for Windows Forms applications and
        a managed wrapper around the versatile <a href="http://www.scintilla.org/">Scintilla</a>
        Windows control. Created with the developer in mind, the ScintllaNET API makes it
        simple to add advanced text editing and syntax highlighting to your application
        or IDE (Integrated Developer Environment). In addition ScintillaNET adds features
        not found in other Scintilla wrappers such as Visual Studio style code snippets,
        integrated find and replace dialogs, true regular expression searches, multiple
        key-command bindings, and back/forward document navigation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ScintillaNET project is hosted on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/">CodePlex</a>
        at the following URL: <a href="http://scintillanet.codeplex.com/">http://scintillanet.codeplex.com/</a>.
        The most up-to-the-minute source code, binaries, and documentation can be found
        at that location.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Installation<a name="Installation"></a></h2>
    <p>
        The following guide is provided for users who wish to use the ScintillaNET control
        in their projects.
    </p>

    <h3>Downloading and Unzipping<a name="DownloadingAndUnzipping"></a></h3>
    <p>
        The ScintillaNET team regularly publishes new releases as features are added and
        bugs are fixed. These releases can easily be obtained from the ScintillaNET Downloads
        page on CodePlex. Files are distributed in both binary and source versions and then
        zip compressed.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Download the binaries recommended release package from the <a href="http://scintillanet.codeplex.com/">
            ScintillaNET</a> Downloads page by clicking the appropriate link and selecting <strong>
                I Agree</strong> from the license terms-of-use popup. (Other releases and versions
            maybe be available but we encourage you to download the "binaries" version of the
            recommended release unless you have a specific reason not to).
        </li>
        <li>
            Unzip the package using a third-party tool or by right-clicking on the file/icon
            in Windows Explorer and selecting <strong>Extract All...</strong> from the context
            menu and following the wizard.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once unzipped you'll want to place the files in a location where they can easily
            be referenced by any of the projects you wish to use ScintillaNET with. For the
            purposes of this guide, we'll assume that the target directory is C:\ScintillaNET.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If the previous steps were completed successfully you should have a folder on your
                    computer with at least the files ScintillaNet.dll and SciLexer.dll. Other license
                    files and documentation may be included as well.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Configuring the Search Path<a name="SearchPath"></a></h3>
    <p>
        Failing to configure the search path or doing it incorrectly trips-up many users.
        ScintillaNET is a wrapper around an umanaged DLL and uses Platform Invoke (P-Invoke)
        calls from the managed ScintillaNet.dll to the native SciLexer.dll to perform its
        magic. In order for that to work the SciLexer.dll must be in one of the places Windows
        uses to locate DLLs. More information about the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7d83bc18.aspx">
            Search Path Used by Windows to Locate a DLL</a> can be found on the MSDN website.
        Of the many ways that Windows can use to find the SciLexer.dll, the instructions
        below illustrate how to modify your PATH environmental variable.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Right-click on the My Computer icon on the Desktop or in the Start Menu and select
            <strong>Properties</strong> from the context menu.
        </li>
        <li>Select the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>Environment Variables</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Add the "C:\ScintillaNET" folder (assuming that is the location of the downloaded
            files, or substitute an alternate location) to the Path variable in the User Variables
            list.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    If there is no Path variable in the User Variables list, add one by clicking <strong>
                    New</strong> and inputing the value "Path" in the Variable Name field and "C:\ScintillaNET"
                    in the Variable Value field.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If there is already a Path variable in the User Variables list, select the Path
                    variable and then click <strong>Edit</strong> to modify. Append "C:\ScintillaNET"
                    to the end of the Variable Value field separating it from any previous value(s)
                    with a semicolon.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Close all open Visual Studio or Visual C# applications and restart them for the
            changes to take effect.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Adding to the Visual Studio Toolbox<a name="VisualStudioToolbox"></a></h3>
    <p>
        Adding the ScintillaNET control to the Visual Studio (or Visual C# Express Edition)
        toolbox makes adding it to one of your forms as easy as dragging and dropping.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            With the Windows Forms designer open in Visual Studio, right-click on the <strong>
            ToolBox</strong> window and select <strong>Choose Items...</strong> from the context
            menu.
        </li>
        <li>
            From the Choose Toolbox Items dialog, select the <strong>.NET Framework Components</strong>
            tab and then click the <strong>Browse...</strong> button.
        </li>
        <li>
            Navigate to the location of the ScintillaNet.dll file on your system ("C:\ScintillaNET\ScintillaNet.dll"
            in our example) and after selecting the file, click the <strong>Open</strong> button.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the Open dialog closes, one or more ScintillaNET components will have been
            added to the list.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ensure that the entry named "Scintilla" is checked and then click the <strong>OK</strong>
            button.
            <ul>
                <li>The Scintilla control should now be listed in the Toolbox. Simply drag it onto a
                    form in the designer to begin using it.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Release 2.2<a name="Release22"></a></h3>
    <p>
        10/21/2009<br />
        Chris Rickard
    </p>
    <p>
        Primarily this is a bugfix release. Only a couple new features are included and
        they are there because they fix/workaround an existing issue.
    </p>
    <h4>Breaking Changes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            All members and strings containing White<strong>S</strong>pace have been changed
            to White<strong>s</strong>pace. Whitespace is the accepted spelling and is the spelling
            used by the .NET framework. (Ignore System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaWhiteSpace :) Along
            the same lines INativeScintilla.GetViewWS() changed to INativeScintilla.GetViewWs().
        </li>
        <li>
            Various members' access changed from public to private or internal. In these cases
            it didn't make much sense to expose them publicly so in theory noone should be using
            them thus this won't break anyones code.
        </li>
        <li>
            Most of the EventArg classes changed their properties to be read-only. This is consistent
            with the style used by the .NET framework. This may potentially break code, initialize
            all the variables in the constructor where appropriate. If there is a legitimate
            need to set an EventArg property after construction I'll add it back in.
        </li>
        <li>
            Markers and Lines.VisibleLines implementations were buggy and have been fixed. If
            you were using them before and made workarounds to compensate for the buggy behavior
            this will most likely break it.
        </li>
        <li>DwellEnd event changed from EventHandler to EventHandler&lt;ScintillaMouseEventArgs&gt;</li>
        <li>
            In the static Utilities class PtrToStringUtf8 and MarshalStr have been removed and
            replaced IntPtrToString.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>New Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            New property Caption sets the Win32 Window Text/Caption. This was introduced to
            make an elegant workaround. The Control.Text property is usually used but has proven
            to be problematic because of ScintillaNet's Text implementation. Also we don't want
            to load a 100mb file in the document then have Windows try to echo this property,
            it adds a ton of unneeded overhead. Caption now controls this completely, it defaults
            to the Scintilla control's Type Name (ScintillaNet.Scintilla unless subclassed)
            but can be changed.
        </li>
        <li>
            UseWhitespaceForeColor/UseWhitespaceBackColor control wether or not the corresponding
            Whitespace colors are used or inherit from the default style.
        </li>
        <li>
            Style class now has an indexer overload that takes a string. The style names are
            specific to each lexer and can be found in the ScintillaNet project under Configuration/BuiltIn/LexerStyleNames.
        </li>
        <li>
            SelectionForeColor/SelectionBackColor now supports the Transparent color. When Transparent
            selection colors don't override styled text colors. While this is inconsistent with
            other properties like WhitespaceForeColor that have a corresponding UseXXX property
            I think it's more intuitive and I may change the others in the future. Note that
            only Transparent is supported, alpha values in any other color are ignored.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Release 2.0.1<a name="Release201"></a></h3>
    <p>
        8/4/2008<br />

    <p>
        For ScintillaNET core this is primarily a maintenance release. It is based off of
        changeset 34880 and includes a few bug fixes from the 2.0 release.
    </p>
    <p>
        The big change with this release is that I've now included a setup file which should
        help new developers get started more easily. It copies the SciLexer.dll to the system
        directory and creates the registry entries to list Scintilla in the list of available
        components for the VS Toolbox.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm not including the source in this release, please take the latest from the Source
        Code tab.
    </p>
    <p>
        Download and run the MSI to have the installer set up your development environment.
        <strong>NOTE</strong> if you already have SciLexer.dll in your system directory
        it will be overwritten with version 1.7.6, which is the latest Scintilla at the
        time of this release.<br />
        <br />
        OR<br />
        <br />
        Download the ZIP file if you want to do a manual installation, read the included
        readme.txt for instructions on how to set up your development environment.
    </p>

    <h3>Release 2.0<a name="Release20"></a></h3>
    <p>
        2/16/2008<br />

    </p>
    <p>
        This is the first release of ScintillaNET based off the 2.0 branch. The entire API
        has been re-written and is <strong>not</strong> compatible with 1x versions. All
        built in features of Scintilla are completely implemented with both a Scintilla
        like API (INativeScintilla) and an abstracted API that hides much of the flat API
        nature of Scintilla (Scintilla control). Many common things that were difficult
        to do with ScintillaNET 1x are now made easier with the new API. Also many new features
        that are not inherent with by Scintilla have been added. These include Print Preview,
        Find and Replace dialogs (with full regular expression support!), GoTo line dialog,
        document navigation, drop markers (like CodeRush), (Visual Studio-like) Code Snippets.
    </p>
    <p>
        The majority of Scintilla's properties can be designed using the Windows Forms designer
        property grid. This is probably the easiest way to get started with many of the
        features, as you get immediate feedback of changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly a brand new configuration system has been created. It uses a multiple layered
        configuration approach that is both very powerful and very easy to get started with.
    </p>
    <p>
        Documentation is still non-existent. I <strong>promise</strong> it will start trickling
        in. For now the best way to learn is to open up the SCide example project and see
        what it does.
    </p>
    <p>
        Read the readme.txt included in both downloads for instructions on how to get started
        in setting up your development environment.

    <h3>Release V6-b1.1 Beta<a name="ReleaseV6b11Beta"></a></h3>
    <p>
        3/11/2007
    </p>
    <p>
        This release uses the DockPanel suite to implement a MDI interface. It also supports
        the SciTE configuration file format, allowing syntax highlighting/folding support
        for most code formats.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are still quite a few items in progress, but I thought it was a good time
        to give everyone a sample of what we've been working on.
    </p>

    <h3>Release V6-b1 Beta<a name="ReleaseV6b1Beta"></a></h3>
    <p>
        1/30/2007
    </p>
    <p>
        The v6-a1 was the first public CodePlex release and I feel we are way past due for
        another :D
    </p>
    <p>
        Beta 1 mainly features a full basic Scintilla implementation and a good basic event
        system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Higher level features included in this release are Smart Indenting and built in
        Find and Replace Controls/Dialogs for your enjoyment. See Release notes for full
        details.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sorry but no help yet. *Maybe* by b2 I'll have gone through and added all the XML
        comments then use an SCDoc project to generate the reference chm.
