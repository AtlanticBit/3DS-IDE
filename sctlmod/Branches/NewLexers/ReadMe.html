    <h1>ScintillaNET</h1>
    <p>
        ScintillaNET is a powerful text editing control for Windows&reg; Forms applications and a managed wrapper around the versatile <a href="http://www.scintilla.org/">Scintilla</a> component.
        Created with the developer in mind, the ScintillaNET API makes it simple to add advanced text editing and syntax highlighting to your application or IDE.
        In addition ScintillaNET adds features not found in other Scintilla wrappers such as Visual Studio&reg; style code snippets, integrated find and replace dialogs, true regular expression searches, multiple key-command bindings, and back/forward document navigation.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a few important things to know about using ScintillaNET:
        <ul>
            <li>ScintillaNET is a wrapper around a native C++ library called <code>SciLexer.dll</code>.</li>
            <li>Starting with ScintillaNET v3.0, the <code>SciLexer.dll</code> (for 32 and 64-bit platforms) comes embedded in the <code>ScintillaNET.dll</code>. During execution the embedded <code>SciLexer.dll</code> is written to the user's temp folder and then loaded from disk.</li>
            <li>This requires that your application have read/write access to the user's temp folder&mdash;which most applications do.</li>
            <li>You can override this behavior if your application doesn't have permissions to the user's temp folder or you would simply prefer to load the <code>SciLexer.dll</code> from another location by calling <code>Scintilla.SetModulePath</code> prior to any <code>Scintilla</code> controls being created.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The ScintillaNET project is hosted on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/">CodePlex</a> at the following URL: <a href="http://scintillanet.codeplex.com">http://scintillanet.codeplex.com</a>.
        The most up-to-the-minute source code, binaries, and documentation can be found at that location.
    </p>
    <p>
        We hope you enjoy using ScintillaNET as much as we enjoy developing it.
